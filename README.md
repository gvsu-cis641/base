The goal of this project is to develop a generative AI system capable of producing new guitar chords and original music compositions. Using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), we aim to teach the model to recognize patterns in music, particularly guitar chord progressions and musical structures. The objective is to create a tool that allows users to generate fresh musical ideas, with the system functioning as a partner in the creative process.
