# Team Name

The project is a virtual assistant designed to schedule, track, record, and analyze events according to user design. The user can schedule events in a specific or recurring manner and view them from a calendar. These scheduled events are connected to an interface the user can design for recording the information they choose upon completing the event. The recording feature is designed to work without scheduled events as well, allowing the user to record more spontaneous activity. The data from these events will be stored and accessible en masse for analysis of time usage and comparisons specific to the properties the user chooses to record. The user will be required to log in, only allowing each user to access their information.
