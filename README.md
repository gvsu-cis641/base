# Lakeshore Misfits

The website color generator is a lightweight web application and tool intended to help developers select an aesthetically pleasing color palette for their website. The web application will check sets of paired colors from the generated color palette and determine which sets meet AA or AAA website accessibility level compliances. The web application will also have a layout color previewer for users to see what the color palette would look like if applied to a static web page and let them determine if they want to keep the colors or generate a new palette. The application may also include a contrast adjustment feature, which evaluates the values of each color in the palette and tweaks them to ensure there is enough contrast ratio between selected pairs of light and dark value colors used for the previews. High contrast ratio color pairs ensures visually impaired users, like those with color blindness, can still easily see and make out the content of the sites.
