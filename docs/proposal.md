# Introduction

(In 2-4 paragraphs, describe your project concept)

# Anticipated Technologies

-   The group formulated and discussed the anticipated technologies needed for this project during our in-class and online meetings. We started an idea of the project concept and its requirements. We used a thought-exercise approach, asking the "how," "what," and "why" questions to each feature in the proposed system or process in the development lifecycle and investigating our options online.

## Communication Tools

-   **Discord** - A free messaging and video chat platform and application. Discord has many benefits. It provides a centralized communication hub for the team to have group texts and video calls. Text conversations and media files shared through Discord are logged and kept on record. The logged conversation provides a source of truth for the team to fall back on and makes note-taking, record-keeping, and documentation more accessible. Our Project Sponser has created a private chat and voice channels for our team, and our team has made good use of it in our initial planning phase.

-   **SMS Group Text Message** - The text message application is available on all modern phones. SMS Group Text Messages are just a free and convenient way for the team to coordinate with each other. The benefit of the text message application is that users, by default, receive a notification anytime a chat comes in, improving the odds of them reading the message. The team has been using group text messaging as a means to set meetup times and places, inform each other of desired conversation topics to cover, and make any changes to the project repository.

## Project Management

-   **Git / Github** - Git and GitHub are two separate repository applications. Git is a desktop-based local repository that can usually be used in conjunction with an integrated development environment (IDE), and GitHub is a remote and online repository. Both applications are used in conjunction and communicate with each other and are used to centralize and save records of all the project files and data sources locally on a user's personal computer and remotely online.

-   **GitHub Project** - GitHub Project is a feature the GitHub repository application provides. The feature offers a collection of basic "agile-like" project management tools to allow individuals or teams to document and track the progress of the project and the development of their software. The tools available in GitHub Project include Task Table (Backlog List), Task Board (Kaban Board), RoadMap (Gantt Chart), Issues (Bug List), Insights (Burndown Chart), and Milestones. It is anticipated that most of the tools will be used to track the team project's progress, schedule, and deadlines.

## Software & Dependencies

-   **Visual Studio Code** - A free integrated development environment (IDE) each team member uses to code and implement the proposed software application.

-   **NPM** - A package manager used with Visual Studio Code to install the necessary framework and library dependencies to build the project web application.

-   **Postman** - A web application that will be used test and validate HTTP requests and responses to and from APIs.

-   **React** - A popular free web application framework that will be used to develop and build the project web application.

-   **Axios** - A library and a dependency of React needed to make HTTP Requests in React.

-   **React Router** - A library and a dependency of React needed to route between pages and manage URL paths in the React-based web application.

## APIs

-   **[Colormind Color Palette Generator](http://colormind.io/api-access/)** - A color palette generator API of the Colormind web application. It will generate and return a 5-color color-palette. The data return will be a nested array of five elements, each element representing a color. Within each child element is an array of three numeric elements, each representing a color's R, G, and B values.

-   **[WebAim Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)** â€“ A color contrast checker API. It takes two color values in HEX format, one as a foreground color and the other as a background color, calculates the contrast ratio between the two colors, and determines if the value meets the standard online web accessibility's AA, AAA, AA-Large, AAA-Large requirements. The data will be returned in a JSON format.
