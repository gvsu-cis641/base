-   60/30/10 Visual Balance Rules for Main Colors

-   Does not to be followed strictly but as guideline

-   60% of site should be a dominant color(s)

    -   Background colors

-   Each % sections can have more than one colors, but they divvied up evenly.
-   Limit to only 2-4 main colors that falls within the 60/30/10 rules, less is better. This excludes variants, extensions, and semantic/utility colors.

-   Brand Color can fall in any cateogry, but it depends on user preferences. Usually its used as secondary or accent colors.

## Variant and Extensions (Rachel How)

-   Dominant and Secondary Colors can have variants or extension, consider either the Material Design or Atlassian color system

-   Brand color might need variant depending on the light or dark mode too.

-   Two version of our accent colors can be provided to make sure it looks good in both light and dark mode.

-   Semantic/utility colors outside color palette can be used to notify success, error, warning, disabled, etc.

## Understanding Colors (DesignerUp)

-   Color is composed of Hue, Tint, Tone, Shade, and Temperature

-   Hue - Dominant color family of the specific color. White, Black, and Gray are never referred as a hue.

-   Tint - Hue with only white added (or moving towards white).

    -   Lightens color but does not make brighter.

    -   Tint ranges from original color to white.

-   Tone - HUE WITH only gray added (or moving towards gray).

    -   Gray is considered truly neutral and has no pigment other than white and black.

    -   Gray will tone down the intensity of any colors

-   Shade - Hue with only black added (or moving towards black).

    -   Darkens color

    -   Shade ranges from the original color to black.

-   Temperature - How color as being warm or cool is percieved

    -   Warm - Can come from increasing red/yellow tones in color wheel

    -   Cool - Can come from increasing blue/green tones in color wheel

    -   Color wheel is split between warm and cool colors

        -   (R, Y, O) = warm
        -   (B, G, P) = cool

    -   Hue shift towards

### Color Models

-   RGB - Color represented by the adding mixture of Red, Green, and Blue

-   HEX - RGB color values represented as hexadecimals

-   HSB / HSV - An alternative way to represent RGB

    -   H: Hue
    -   S: Saturation
    -   V/B: Value/Brightness (The Same)
        -   value or brightness is not impact saturation

-   HSL - An alternative way to represent RGB and HSL / HSV

    -   lightness is impacted by the saturation

## Colors Harmonies (Adobe / DesignerUp)

-   Monochromatic - Uses one hue, with varying saturation and brightness.

-   Analogous - Use hues that are next to each other on the wheel.

-   Complementary - Use hues that are on opposite of the color wheels.

-   Split-Complementary - Use hues that are on either side of the complementing hue.

-   Double-Split Complementary - Uses hues on either side of main hue, and on either side of the complementing hue.

-   Triadic - Use three hues that are spaced evenly along the color wheel.

-   Square - Uses four hues that are spaced evenly along the color wheel.

-   Play with saturation and brightness to create more refine palette.

## Color Palette Guide (DesignerUp / Futur Academy)

-   Darker Color Variants = Increase Saturation, Decrease Brightness
