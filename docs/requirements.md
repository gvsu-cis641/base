# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## Overview
This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the Music Generation Project. The purpose is to define the scope, features, and constraints of the system, which leverages Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to generate new musical compositions based on user inputs.

## Functional Requirements

- **F1:** The system shall allow users to input seed melodies or chord progressions to guide the generated output.  
- **F2:** The system shall generate new music compositions in real-time based on user-defined parameters.  
- **F3:** The system shall provide an export feature to save generated compositions as MIDI or audio files for external use.  
- **F4:** The system shall allow users to adjust VAE parameters (such as latent space dimensions) to influence the creative process dynamically.  

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **N1:** The system shall produce musical outputs within 5 seconds of receiving input to ensure a smooth user experience.  
- **N2:** The system shall maintain a 95% uptime to support users with uninterrupted access.  
- **N3:** The user interface shall be intuitive and require no more than 10 minutes of exploration to understand all features.  
- **N4:** The system shall support cross-platform compatibility, including web browsers and mobile devices, to maximize accessibility.
