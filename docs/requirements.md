# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## Overview
This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the Music Generation Project. The purpose is to define the scope, features, and constraints of the system, which leverages Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to generate new musical compositions based on user inputs.

## Functional Requirements

1. **User Input Handling**
   1. FR1: The system shall allow users to input seed melodies to guide music generation.
   2. FR2: The system shall enable users to define genre, tempo, and chord preferences.
   3. FR3: The system shall provide a real-time preview of the generated music.
   4. FR4: The system shall allow users to export compositions as MIDI or audio files.

2. **Customization Options**
   1. FR5: The system shall allow users to adjust VAE parameters dynamically.
   2. FR6: The system shall enable users to select between different output styles (e.g., jazz, classical, rock).

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**
   1. NFR1: The system shall generate musical outputs within 5 seconds of input.
   2. NFR2: The system shall maintain 95% uptime to ensure reliability.

2. **Usability**
   1. NFR3: The system shall have an intuitive user interface that requires less than 10 minutes of exploration.
   2. NFR4: The system shall support cross-platform compatibility, including web and mobile devices.
