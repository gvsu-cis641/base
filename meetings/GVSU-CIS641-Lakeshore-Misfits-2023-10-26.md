## Discussion points:

### Week 2, Sprint Task Clarification

-   Selena needs clarification about how to do certain things in React and wants a better understanding of the scope and expectations of her tasks and other people's tasks for this week.

-   Initially, Selena said she would try and finish her Week 2 Sprint tasks by Sunday but was concerned she might not be able to get all done by then.

-   Khiem clarified Selena's task to her. Khiem explained that for her tasks...

    -   Selena only needs to worry about stubbing the html template layout for her tasks.
    -   Selena does not need to worry about applying styles or properties. Khiem is investigating that aspect of React right now and will show and assist her on that aspect of the application in a future Sprint and set of tasks.
    -   Selena is scheduled for two (2) weeks or two (2) sprint cycles to complete the three (3) tasks assigned to her.

-   For this week, Khiem said his task is to...

    -   Establish and set the global palette state object
    -   Figure out how to transfer and manipulate the value in that object between different components via React's Props and Contexts.
    -   Refine the structural model of the components, model classes, service classes, etc. in the application.
    -   Figure out how to manipulate HTML elements or React Component styles in React.

-   Khiem clarified to Selena that for Munmi's tasks, she is assigned to figure out how to use Axios and populate those service files for the team.

-   Khiem also mentioned that he added some dependencies to the main branch, like AwesomeFont for logos and TinyColor2 for Color model classes and methods. Khiem said with the TinyColor2 library; he might not need to build a custom Color Service file.

### Week 2, Sprint Tasks and Implementation Progress

-   Selena said she has started working on the About Us Page and will try and start on one of the other page layouts this weekend.

-   Khiem mentioned that he created a small React Application on Stackblitz.com to tease the concepts and features he said earlier.

    -   [https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-usecontext-demo-pcfyhm?file=index.js](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-usecontext-demo-pcfyhm?file=index.js)

    -   Khiem has figured out how to update values with React's UseStates.

    -   Khiem has figured out how to apply new styles to HTML elements and components in React.

    -   Khiem said he is currently trying to figure out how to structure the classes and component files in React properly and mentioned the team would likely need to refine the models.

    -   Also, Khiem has to figure out when and where to implement and utilize use states, context, and props and how to combine the three React features.

    -   Khiem said building a small application on BlitzStack has been very helpful in teasing out the layouts and structure of the application, and he will have it finalized and implement the concept into the actual React application by this Sunday.

-   Khiem showed Selena a live demo of the stackblitz application and what he's planning for the structural changes to the layout, especially, now that we are utilizing the TinyColor2 class and Library.
