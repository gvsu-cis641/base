    -   Munmi is very happy that she is learning web development and React and wants to use it more for personal projects.

-   The team asked Munmi to share her screen, and the team walked her through the process of pushing the changes into her working branch into the remote Github Repository, making a pull request to merge into the remote branch, and then pulling in her main branch to get the latest updates.

-   Selena tried to integrate the color data and color pair data into the styles for the Mock Site page and Contrast Checker page through the palette context created but could not get it to work.

-   The team asked her to share her screen, and Khiem instructed her to properly utilize the palette context with UseContext and the colors data for the pages' element styles.
