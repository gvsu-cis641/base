## Discussion points:
-   We discussed on the scope of the project
    -	Recalled Professor Fredericks, said our final product only has to be functional and a prototype or proof of concept. It might not even work, and that’s okay.

    -	The project will focus more on the planning, analysis, and design component.

    -	This means we should scale back our project proposal or idea.
        -	We should likely consider and revise any project that heavily depends on a database. Creating and managing a database is not easy and adds another level of complexity.

        -	Professor Fredericks also said don’t have to run a database through the cloud or backend server, we can run it on a local server, and show that it works.

-   We discussed on the project scope/considerations
    -	Met with the team after class. We decided from our three project ideas to pick the website color palette generator and contrast checker (first pick).

        -	It’s something fun, exciting, and something that hasn’t been done too much before, especially a team project.

        -	Envisioning an application with a control panel and display.
            -	A simple button on the panel will adjust the static layout color.

            -	Another button might direct a user to the page that checks the color contrast of colors.
                -	Let people know they can use the color, but it's not web-accessible.

        -	It does have some algorithms to code and requires a lot of tools and technology, but so does the other.
            -	The algorithms come from mathematical formulas that can be found online and don’t seem too bad to code.

        -	There are free APIs out there to help generate color palettes for us or check a paired color contrast ratio value.
            -	Color palette generator API: http://colormind.io/api-access/
            -	Contrast Checker API: https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/

        -	A database is not really required and can be removed. This will allow us to focus on the front end.

        -	There are enough pieces for team members to work on.

    -	Word puzzle game, a hangman or wordle variant, that provides the user with a word’s definition. It’s unique enough, not overdone, and within the scope of the project (second pick).

        -	This would be a good alternative/backup.

        -	Might only require one or two screens.

        -	Requires the use of API calls and other technologies associated with it.
            -	There is a free dictionary API out on the internet somewhere.

        -	Requires algorithm for a user to count guesses and match letters to the selected word. Produce an alert when the user guesses correctly.
            -	Algorithm for making that work might have to be written from scratch, and that has a risk to it.

        -	A database and table for high-score keeping might be required, but it won’t be too complex and can be simplified to keep within the project's scope.

            -	There is still concern related to setting up and managing a database.

    -	The movie ticket project idea was a good idea but overdone as semester projects and is a lot more complex for the scope required for the code (leaning towards scrapping).
        -	Heavily dependent on a database.

        -	If the database does not work, then the whole project won’t work.

        -	It might take too much time and energy to build a database.

        -	It requires too many screens to step through ticketing and movie options.

-   We discussed on the team member experiences:
    -	Technologies
        -	Selena:
            -	Familiar with HTML, CSS, JS
            -	Had some exposure to React, will need a refresher and relearn concepts
        -	Munmi:
            -	Familiar with HTML, CSS, JS, Python
            -	Has no experience with React, will need to learn concepts
        -	Khiem:
            -	Familiar with HTML, CSS, JS, Angular
            -	Had some exposure with React, will need a refresher and relearn concepts
    -   We need to factor in team experiences with the technologies when considering the scale and scope of work.

## Goals for next week (include responsibilities):

-   The team will meet again next week to discuss on the use cases of the project.
