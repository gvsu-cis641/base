Date: 2023-10-23

Time: 9:00 AM - 9:30 AM

## Discussion points:

### Week 1, Sprint Tasks and Implementation News

-   Khiem managed to set up the React Application and stub out the initial layout for it.

    -   All the folders and files we needed for our project. Basically, scaffolds/bones that others can apply the meat to.

    -   Khiem created the initial page components, section components, service components, and general components and tested all of the child components into their respective parent components.

    -   Khiem applied some simple styles to create the desired layout, as shown in the Figma mockups and applied a bit of background colors to create some visual dividers for each section and subsections on the application.

    -   Khiem established the routers and navigations to application and applied links to the main three pages in the Navigation panel.

### Week 2, Sprint Kickoff

-   Khiem let the team know we are officially in the 2nd Sprint Week. However, there is no need to start until after Fall Break.

-   Khiem has created a GitHub Project - Sprint - Week 2 task list/board and it can be found here:

-   Khiem believes moving forward, the team should start using GitHub Project and create working branches from our main branch for the task we're working on and for the sake of version control.

    -   Khiem reasons that all of the team members will be working on different aspects of the project that could impact other works. If something goes wrong, we want to avoid bricking the main branch or conflict with other people's work.

    -   If it's code-implementation or related, create a working branch. Work on it; once the team member feel like they are are done, they can make a push to the GitHub (or remote repo) and then merge it to the main branch, via a pull request

    -   All document updates can just be done at the main branch

-   Khiem understands version control is a lot to ask, and as such, he created a GitHub Project Workflow document for us last night. The team can find it below:

-   IMPORTANT NOTE: When a team member pulls down the latest updates from the remote/GITHUB main branch, they must perform a few steps for the React Application to run successfully. Khiem also created a guide for the team here:

    -   [https://github.com/khnguyen88/GVSU-CIS641-Lakeshore-Misfits/blob/main/docs/react-startup-guide/react-startup-guide.md](https://github.com/khnguyen88/GVSU-CIS641-Lakeshore-Misfits/blob/main/docs/react-startup-guide/react-startup-guide.md)

-   Khiem also created the original resource document into a markdown file, which can be found here:

    -   [https://github.com/khnguyen88/GVSU-CIS641-Lakeshore-Misfits/blob/main/docs/resource-hub/resource-document.md](https://github.com/khnguyen88/GVSU-CIS641-Lakeshore-Misfits/blob/main/docs/resource-hub/resource-document.md)

-   The team said they will read over the Week 2 GitHub Project and associated documents created for the project and start their respective tasks once the fall break is over.

## Goals for this week (include responsibilities):

-   The team will review the GitHub Project document and React Startup guide.

    -   Responsibilities: Developer, All
