Date: 2023-10-29

Time: 9:00 PM - 10:00 PM

## Discussion points:

### Week 2, Sprint Tasks and Implementation Progress

-   Munmi has not progressed on the API Service tasks due to several blockers.

    -   Munmi has not set up a Visual Studio code project folder or linked it to GitHub.

    -   Munmi has been making all the document and file changes in the local and remote repositories through Git Bash.

    -   Munmi has been looking at how to implement Axios but is unfamiliar with JavaScript or React and will need assistance next week.

    -   Munmi asked if she could use Python to make the HTTP request to the two API services, but Khiem suggested that she just try and learn how to use JavaScript. Khiem said it makes no sense to use Python; there are already established REST APIs, and that would cause us to change our requirements.

    -   Munmi explained part of the issue is her poor network connection, which makes communication with the team hard. Khiem suggests in the future, if she has any problems, make a post on the team's Discord chat or talk to the team in person during class.

-   Selena will wrap up the About Us Page today and work on the other layouts later this week.

-   Khiem teased out some of the features, components, and concepts needed for the application in his Stackblitz demo application.

-   Khiem implemented the global Palette UseState and Context in a PaletteContext file and applied it to the App component and all subsequent child components in the project application.

-   Khiem created some new model classes, general component classes, and page component classes in the project application and applied React's Use State, Contexts, and Props to them.

-   Khiem also updated the section components classes, general component classes, and service classes to either integrate new components to the navigation, apply React's Use State, Contexts, and Props to them, or fix the structure of the files.

-   Khiem made a pull request of his working branch and merged it into the remote main branch, asked that the team pull down the latest remote main branch into their local main branch and merge their working main branch into their current working branch.

-   Khiem demoed the latest WIP React application with the changes he made.

-   Selena asked if the team could help her update her working branch. Selena shared her screen, and Khiem walked her through the process.

    -   Selena ran the application and verified she had the latest changes.

-   Munmi asked the team for some assistance on how to set up her Visual Studio Code Project Folder.

    -   Selena shared her screen and walked Munmi through the process.

    -   Khiem mentioned that he has written instructions and steps to do so in the Project document folder.

### Week 3, Sprint Tasks Planning

-   The team asked Munmi if she followed the Tic-Tac-Toe tutorial or read any documents. Munmi said she has but still needs help finding React and Javascript.

-   The team asked if Munmi wanted to work on other tasks, but Munmi said she still wanted to try and learn React but would need help with her API Service tasks.

    -   Khiem will help Munmi with the API Service tasks late next week after he finishes the homework.

-   Khiem suggested that if Munmi does not feel comfortable with React or JavaScript, the functional and structural models will need to be refined, and the behavioral models will need to be created since we are doing Agile SDLC, and everything is getting updated in increments and iterations.

    -   Khiem can help sketch some rough drawings that Munmi can then refine and clean up.

-   Khiem will roll over the tasks from the Week 2 Sprint over into the Week 3 Sprint and plan out some new tasks, accounting for the homework this week.

-   Khiem will also update and refine the Gantt Chart and Schedule this week based on the Week 1 and Week 2 sprint progress.

-   The team will have more check-ins with each other to make sure all blockers get resolved as soon as possible.
