## Discussion points:

### Week 3, Sprint Tasks and Implementation Progress

-   Progress on Week 3 has been a bit slow due to the recent CIS641 HW assignment and other course assignments, but enough slack time has been built in that some tasks can be pushed to next week.

-   Selena has finished wrapping and populated the static layouts for the Mock Site Page, Contrast Checker Page, and About Us Page.

-   Khiem took over the API Services tasks and built some prototypes on StackBlitz to understand how to implement and utilize the Axios library and methods, the async/await keywords, and return responses to the caller.

    -   Khiem worked with Munmi and showed her how the Axios library can be implemented into code and how it works.

-   Munmi said she finally has her environment set up and has this sprint spent watching tutorial videos and getting familiar with React to work on the implementation task for the Week 4 sprint.

    -   Munmi built some throwaway prototype components to get practice.

-   Khiem reviewed the tasks, plans, and refinements of the Week 3 sprint and wrote some initial tasks for the Week 4 sprint.

-   Khiem reviewed/updated the project schedule and the Gantt chart to reflect the progress from Week 3 Implementation.

-   Khiem has begun reviewing and marking the initial diagram models and placed them in the model-markup and ./doc/review-markups subdirectory in the GitHub repository.

### Week 4, Sprint Tasks Planning

-   The team has looked over the class Final Deliverable rubric.

-   Khiem believes the team should start focusing on model and design refinements throughout the week to ease the effort for final deliverables due at the beginning of December, and have begun planning and posting the Week 4 sprint tasks on GitHub Project.

-   The team agreed to extend the software development life cycle to an extra week to focus on updating and finetuning the models developed for application from the initial schedule since it relates to the project's final deliverable.

-   Khiem will likely carry over and work on the outstanding API Service tasks at the start of the Week 4 sprints.

-   The team will be assigned two major tasks this coming sprint, one related to code implementation and the other related to model diagram refinement and creation associated with the project.

    -   Selena will be tasked with the revision and development of the use-case diagrams.

    -   Munmi will be tasked with the revision and development of the activity diagrams.

    -   Khiem will be tasked with the revision and development of the class and object diagrams.

-   Munmi said she wants to contribute to the implementation and will take on the "Create the PairColorContrast card component" task. This task is one of the Sprint 4 tasks.

    -   Khiem showed Munmi how to create a new branch from an issue/task on GitHub, fetch the latest main branch and check out the newly created work branch in Visual Studio.
